## How It Works
The indicator calculates the yellow signal line using the `iMA` function, which is a built-in function of the MQL5 language. It retrieves the close price of the specified period and applies the Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculation method.

The `OnInit` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers for the yellow signal line and the zero line. It also sets the indicator label.

The `OnCalculate` function is where the main calculations and trading opportunities are identified. It calculates the yellow signal line for each bar in the chart's history. Then, it checks if the yellow signal line crossed the zero line in an upward or downward direction. If a crossing occurs, a buying or selling opportunity is detected, respectively.
